# Diarization

In this fodler it is done the diarization task. In order to do this, what we have done is to transcript the audio file making use of Whisper, and constructing the groundtruth by editing the output generated by the model.

There exists different ways to construct the ground truth:
1. Considering just the speech as it is said in the audiofile
2. Correcting the mistakes of the speech. 

For example, in a normal improvized speech, the speaker may do some repetitions of the words because she/he may be thinking at the same time while speaking. 

Example:

"I want... I want potatoes for lunch."

Also it is possible that the speaker makes some speaking mistakes. In Spanish it is very clear. There are some ortografical mistakes like "leísmo", "laísmo", and "loísmo". Some of them can be considered as dialect variant but (I don't remember which) is considered as a mistake. 

Because the Transformer's decoder has language information, the text generated by Whisper also contains intrinsic language information. This means that it is possible that Whisper corrects this mistakes and, for example, doesn't repeat the sentence. This maybe can be change with prompt engineering but idk.

In conclusion, because Whisper has a Transformers' decoder it is possible that corrects the speech, achieving a higher WER. 


## Results 
The results obtained are the following:

|         	| WER   	| WAcc  	|
|---------	|-------	|-------	|
| Whisper 	| 0.153 	| 0.847 	|
