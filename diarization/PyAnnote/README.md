# PyAnnote

Note: I haven't used this script for a while. However, I changed the folders and I reorganized the files, so the PATHS need to be changed.

Also, it is important to say, the huggingface token is deprecated and needs to be changed. Replace the token with you token and be sure to have the Meta permissions to use the Pyannote.
